## 🚀 Projects  

### 1. Email → JSON Extractor  
- **Input:** Raw email text  
- **Output:** Structured JSON → `{ "client_name": "", "action_items": [] }`  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Schema-first prompt design  
  - Consistent JSON validation  
  - Modular code with type hints & error handling  

### 2. Product Features → Marketing Content  
- **Input:** Product details (e.g., “Luxury perfume, gold packaging, Dubai market”)  
- **Output:**  
  - Blog intro  
  - LinkedIn caption  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Reusable prompt templates  
  - Few-shot patterns for structured content generation  
  - Demonstrates rapid content creation for marketing workflows  

### 3. CRM Data → Pitch Draft  
- **Input:** CRM notes (client info + context)  
- **Output:** Tailored pitch draft (email format)  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Workflow from unstructured CRM text → business-ready pitch  
  - Clean Jupyter Notebook demo  
  - LLM applied to sales/CRM automation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **Hugging Face Inference API** (transformer-based models)  
- **Requests** (API calls)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (demo + experimentation)  

---

## 🔑 Key Learnings  
- **API integration:** Secure auth, clean request handling  
- **Prompt engineering:** Schema-first, deterministic formatting, few-shot examples  
- **Reusable code design:** Functions, type hints, error handling, logging  
- **Business focus:** Bridging analytics and ML to drive sales/marketing efficiency

## 📌 Next Steps  
- Extend outputs into dashboards/CRM systems  
- Add support for multiple models (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)
